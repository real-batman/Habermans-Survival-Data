# Exploratory Data Analysis on Haberman's Survival Data.

## Objective-
To classify/predict a patient survival who had undergone surgery for breast cancer.

## Conclusion-
• The given dataset is imbalanced as it does not contain an equal number of data points for each class.
• The given dataset is not linearly separable from each class. There are too much overlapping in the data points and hence it is very difficult to classify.
• somehow axillary_lymph_node is giving some intuition in the dataset.
• we can not build a simple model using only if else conditions we need to have some more complex technique to handle this dataset.
